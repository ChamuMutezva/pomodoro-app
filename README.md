# Frontend Mentor - Pomodoro app

This is another challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The output is as close as possible to the
design. 
The ring was created through an inspiration from [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/building-progress-ring-quickly/)
Used input type number with minimun and maximum values to have auto buttons to increase and decrease the values,
this did not work on mobile as the increamental buttons did not show up. Disabled the buttons and used custom buttoms 
to control.
